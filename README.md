# AdventureWorks-ETL-Pipeline
An end-to-end Azure Data Engineering project using AdventureWorks data. The pipeline extracts data via Azure Data Factory, stores it in Azure Data Lake, transforms it in Databricks, and loads it into Synapse Analytics for reporting. 

Hereâ€™s an expanded version of your project overview for the README file on GitHub:

## Pipeline Overview

### 1. **Data Extraction**
   - **Tool Used:** Azure Data Factory (ADF)
   - **Process:** 
     - Data is extracted from the AdventureWorks API using ADF.
     - The extraction process is fully automated, ensuring that the latest data is always available.
     - ADF orchestrates the workflow and ensures data is continuously pulled from the source.

### 2. **Data Storage**
   - **Tool Used:** Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)
   - **Process:** 
     - The raw data extracted from the API is loaded into Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) as the **raw layer**.
     - This serves as the foundation for further transformations and processing.
     - Data is stored in its raw format for future reference and auditing purposes.

### 3. **Data Transformation**
   - **Tool Used:** Databricks
   - **Process:** 
     - Data cleansing and transformation are performed within **Databricks** (the **silver layer**).
     - In this stage, unnecessary or malformed data is removed, and the data is structured into a usable format.
     - Databricks allows for scalable, distributed data processing, ensuring that even large datasets are handled efficiently.
   
### 4. **Data Analytics**
   - **Tool Used:** Azure Synapse Analytics
   - **Process:** 
     - The transformed data is loaded into **Azure Synapse Analytics** (the **gold layer**).
     - This is where data modeling takes place, and data is optimized for querying.
     - Azure Synapse Analytics integrates seamlessly with other Azure services, providing fast and efficient querying of large datasets.
   
## Key Technologies Used

- **Azure Data Factory (ADF):** Orchestrates data extraction and movement across the pipeline.
- **Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS):** Provides a scalable and cost-effective storage solution for raw and intermediate data.
- **Databricks:** Facilitates scalable data transformations, including data cleansing, aggregation, and enrichment.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics:** Provides a powerful platform for data modeling and querying at scale.
- **Power BI:** Allows for creating interactive visualizations and dashboards to provide actionable insights.
